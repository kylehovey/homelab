# Homelab Presentation

I decided to implement my presentation on self-hosting as an [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/) vault. To view the presentation:

1. Clone/Download this project
2. Download Obsidian
3. Open the downloaded folder as an Obsidian Vault

The files are all markdown, so any markdown editor/viewer should also work just fine. Vim Wiki will also work.
