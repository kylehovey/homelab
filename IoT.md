* IoT has a troubled past, and present, but it can be done well
* When evaluating an IoT product ask:
	* Does this add value or new capabilities to my home?
	* If it loses power or internet, will it still work?
	* Is all of the data and communication local? If not, do I trust the manufacturer?

I aim to have all of my devices work on the local network without talking to outside services. In some cases, this isn't possible, but for the most part it is possible. Doing this also makes it a lot easier for self-hosting.
