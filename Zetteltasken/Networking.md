# Access

To access your self-hosted services outside of your home, you'll need to set up [Port Forwarding](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Port_forwarding), or a VPN like [Tailscale](https://tailscale.com/). I recommend the latter, as it's easier to keep secure.

# Security

When forwarding services to the outside world, be very careful about what you allow. Once something is on the open internet, it will recieve malicious login attempts and outdated software is liable to be compromised.

* Keep services up to date
* Keep an eye out for security updates from organizations that maintain these service
* Consider putting [[IoT]] devices on their own network separate from your personal devices
